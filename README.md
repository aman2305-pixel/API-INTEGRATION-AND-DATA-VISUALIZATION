The first task required fetching data from a public API, such as OpenWeatherMap, and visualizing it using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. I began by integrating the OpenWeatherMap API, sending HTTP requests using the requests module to retrieve weather data in JSON format. After extracting relevant data points such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visually appealing graphs and charts. This task enhanced my skills in API handling, data extraction, and visualization. Running the script on VS Code allowed me to debug effectively and use extensions that formatted the code neatly. The final deliverable included a well-commented Python script and a visualization dashboard showing weather patterns across different cities.
